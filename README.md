# Happy Numbers

## Introduction
A happy number is defined by the following process: starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1. Numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

## Example
For example, if you input `19`, the process will be as follows:
1. 1² + 9² = 82
2. 8² + 2² = 68
3. 6² + 8² = 100
4. 1² + 0² + 0² = 1

## How to Run the Code
First ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, you can run the code by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
python main.py
```
Now, you can input any positive integer to check if it is a happy number.
